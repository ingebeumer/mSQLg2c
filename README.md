#### <i>A Microsoft Workshop</i>

<p style="border-bottom: 1px solid lightgrey;"></p>

<h2><img style="float: left; margin: 0px 15px 15px 0px;" src="https://github.com/microsoft/sqlworkshops/blob/master/graphics/textbubble.png?raw=true"> About this Workshop</h2>

Welcome to this Microsoft solutions workshop on creating a modern data estate using SQL Server in on-premises, in-cloud and hybrid solutions. In this one-day workshop, you'll learn how to use the latest improvements in SQL Server and Azure SQL help you solve real-world challenges. 

The Modules in this workshop lead you through conceptual and hands-on topics ranging from the newest technical features in SQL Server to its implementation in all the platforms it runs on. You'll learn not only specific technologies, but how to assemble them into a complete solution based on customer needs and requests.   

You'll start by learning about auditing your current data estate and how to evaluate any gaps, moving on to understanding the latest improvements in SQL Server, and then learn about the ways you can leverage SQL in Microsoft Azure (and how to get there) - all with a focus on how to extrapolate what you have learned to create other solutions for your organization. You'll end the day with a "What to Use When" module explaining how to create your own data estate architecture.

This Workshop contains lecture and hands on lab work, and is particularly useful for Solution Architects, Data Architects, Application Architects, Technical Sellers, and Application Developers. A laptop, Microsoft Azure account, and experience with SQL is considered a prerequisite.

This README.MD file explains how the workshop is laid out, what you will learn, and the technologies you will use in this solution.

<h2><img style="float: left; margin: 0px 15px 15px 0px;" src="https://github.com/microsoft/sqlworkshops/blob/master/graphics/building1.png?raw=true"> Business Applications of this Workshop</h2>

Businesses require near real-time insights from ever-larger sets of data from a variety of sources. Many have not explored the improvements made in the latest versions of SQL Server, and some are only now exploring the cloud as a computing platform. As time has progressed, a more dramatic upgrade process may be required.

In addition to traditional Online Transaction Processing (OLTP) and Online Analytic Processing (OLAP) workloads, some industry examples of data processing from multiple sources of data at scale are:

<h2><img style="float: left; margin: 0px 15px 15px 0px;" src="https://github.com/microsoft/sqlworkshops/blob/master/graphics/owl.png?raw=true"> <a name="prereqs">Before Taking this Workshop</a></h2>

You'll need a local system or Virtual Machine that you are able to install software on. The workshop demonstrations use Microsoft Windows as an operating system and all examples use Windows for the workshop. Optionally, you can use a Microsoft Azure Virtual Machine (VM) to install the software on and work with the solution.

You must have a Microsoft Azure account with the ability to create assets, specifically the Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS).

This workshop expects that you understand data structures and working with SQL Server and computer networks. This workshop does not expect you to have any prior data science knowledge, but a basic knowledge of statistics and data science is helpful in the Data Science sections. Knowledge of SQL Server, Azure Data and AI services, Python, and Jupyter Notebooks is helpful but not required. AI techniques are implemented in R and Python packages. Solution templates are implemented using Azure services, development tools, and SDKs. You should have experience working with the Microsoft Azure Platform.

If you are new to these, here are a few references you can complete prior to class: 

-  [Microsoft SQL Server](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/relational-databases/database-engine-tutorials?view=sql-server-ver15)
-  [Microsoft Azure](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/paths/azure-fundamentals/)

<a href="https://github.com/sqlballs/mSQLg2c/blob/Buck/modules/01-SetupandWorkshopMethodology.md" target="_blank">A full prerequisites document is located here</a>. These instructions should be completed before the workshop starts, since you will not have time to cover these in class. <i>Remember to "Stop" any Virtual Machines from the Azure Portal when not taking the class so that you do incur charges (shutting down the machine in the VM itself is not sufficient)</i>.
