<p style="border-bottom: 1px solid lightgrey;"></p>

<img style="float: left; margin: 0px 15px 15px 0px;" src="https://github.com/microsoft/sqlworkshops/blob/master/graphics/textbubble.png?raw=true"> <h2>03 - SQL Server Improvements</h2>

In this workshop you'll cover how to systematically create a modern data estate using SQL Server in on-premises, in-cloud and hybrid solutions.

In each module you'll get more references, which you should follow up on to learn more. Also watch for links within the text - click on each one to explore that topic.

(<a href="file:///url" target="_blank">Make sure you check out the <b>Pre-Requisites</b> page before you start</a>. You'll need all of the items loaded there before you can proceed with the workshop.)

Using the <a href="https://github.com/sqlballs/mSQLg2c/blob/main/modules/02-AuditingYour%20DataEstateArchitecture.md">processes, tools and procedures from the Auditing  Module</a>, the WideWorldImporters company has completed an initial audit of their data estate.They found multiple sources of data in their organization, including text files, spreadsheets, and Relational Database Management Systems (RDBMS) including SQL Server 2012 Instances along with some Instances of SQL Server 2017 for <a href = "https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/samples/wide-world-importers-what-is?view=sql-server-2017" target="_blank">their primary Line of Business (LOB) databases</a>.

WideWorldImporters <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/sql-server/end-of-support/sql-server-end-of-support-overview?view=sql-server-ver16#lifecycle-dates">needs to upgrade the software that is out of support</a> and also evaulate which versions and editions will solve their problems. They have settled on evaulating the delta between SQL Server 2017 and the latest version of the on-premises SQL Server product, and they have divided their evaluation into various categories that they are interested in:

<h2 id="3.1"><img style="float: left; margin: 0px 15px 15px 0px;" src="https://github.com/microsoft/sqlworkshops/blob/master/graphics/pencil2.png?raw=true">3.1 Deployment Improvements</h2>
In the latest version, you can deploy SQL Server to the Microsoft Windows operating systems as well as various distributions of the Linux operating system.  Newer deployment scenarios also include deploying SQL Server on Containers, Kubernetes, and new options in the Microsoft Azure platform such as Azure SQL Edge.
<p></p>

> WideWorld Importers has decided to evaluate the on-premises latest version of SQL Server separately from the Microsoft Azure platform deployment options. They also want to evaluate the on-premises to cloud and cloud to on-premises interactions separately.

<p></p>

<h3>SQL Server on Windows</h3>
The latest version of SQL Server is supported on all current Microsoft Windows desktop and server operating systems, including Windows 11 (Developer and Express Editions) and Windows 2022 Server. You can <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/troubleshoot/sql/general/use-sql-server-in-windows">learn more about each version of the Microsoft Windows operating system and the SQL Server version it supports at this reference</a>.

Your selection of features and components should be based on your application needs. The different <i>Editions</i> of SQL Server have unique features, performance, runtime, and cost implications. You can <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/sql-server/editions-and-components-of-sql-server-2019?view=sql-server-ver16#-editions">learn more about the Editions of SQL Server and the features supported in each at this reference</a>.

All features in each Edition for the latest version of SQL Server are supported on the Microsoft Windows operating system, including:
- Hybrid buffer pool with direct write, which reduces the number of memcpy commands that need to be performed on modified data or index pages residing on PMEM devices
- Integrated acceleration & offloading acceleration technologies from partners such as Intel to provide extended capabilities, such as IntelÂ® QuickAssist Technology (QAT) which provides backup compression and hardware offloading
- Leverages new hardware capabilities, including the Advanced Vector Extension (AVX) 512 extension to improve batch mode operations

<h3>SQL Server on Virtual Machines</h3>
Bare-metal installations of an operating system such as Windows are deployed on hardware using an operating system <i>Kernel</i>, and additional software to bring all of the hardware into a set of calls to the "Big Four": CPU, Memory, Storage, and Networking.

One abstraction layer above installing software directly on hardware is using a <i>Hypervisor</i>. In essence, this layer uses the base operating system to emulate hardware. You install an operating system (called a Guest OS) on the Hypervisor (called the Host), and the Guest OS acts as if it is on bare-metal.

<img src="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/44539iF185A2EF8FFAB4FF?v=1.0" width=400>

In this abstraction level, you have full control (and responsibility) for the entire operating system, but not the hardware. This isolates all process space and provides an entire "Virtual Machine" to applications. For scale-out systems, a Virtual Machine allows for a distribution and control of complete computer environments using only software.

You can read <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/virtualization/hyper-v-on-windows/reference/tlfs">the details of Microsoft's Hypervisor at this reference</a>.

The latest version of SQL Server supports all of the features associated with the applicable Edition for both Windows and Linux in a Virtualized environemnt, with <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/troubleshoot/sql/general/support-policy-hardware-virtualization-product">the considerations described at this reference</a>.

<h3>SQL Server on Linux</h3>
In the latest version, SQL Server runs on Red Hat Enterprise Linux, SUSE Linux Enterprise Server, and Ubuntu Linux. WideWorld Importers is currently running Red Hat Linux at one of their processing plants, and is interested in some of the workloads that might be useful on that platform. As they test, their primary concern is the performance aspect of SQL Server in Linux, and they find that performance is on-par with the Windows deployments due to the architecture of the Platform Abstration Layer (PAL) implemented to run the SQL Server Engine code on Linux:

<p></p>
<img src="https://cloudblogs.microsoft.com/uploads/prod/2016/12/04_thumb.png" width=300>
<p></p>

The latest version of SQL Server on Linux supports the following improvements:
- Replication
- Support for the Microsoft Distributed Transaction Coordinator (MSDTC)
- OpenLDAP support for third-party AD providers
- Machine Learning Services on Linux
- TempDB improvements, such as multiple TempDB data files, similar to the default SQL Server installation on Windows
- PolyBase
- PolyBase type mapping
- Change Data Capture (CDC) support

There are specific versions and support considerations for each distribution of Linux. A <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/linux/sql-server-linux-whats-new-2019?view=sql-server-ver16">list of these requirements is available at this reference</a>, and a <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/linux/sql-server-linux-editions-and-components-2022?view=sql-server-ver16">list of Editions and supported features for SQL Server on Linux is at this reference</a>. 

You can <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/linux/sql-server-linux-overview?view=sql-server-ver16">learn more about the SQL Server on Linux architecture at this reference</a>.

<h3>SQL Server in Containers</h3>
The introduction of SQL Server running on Linux allows for the next level of hardware abstraction, called a <i>Container</i>. There are various types of Container technologies, in this workshop, you will focus on the Docker container format, as implemented in Windows using the <i>Moby</i> framework.

A Container is provided by the Container Runtime (Such as <i>containerd</i>) runtime engine, which sits above the operating system (Windows or Linux). In this abstraction, you do not control the hardware or the operating system. The Container has a specific protected memory space, and can contain binaries such as Python, R, SQL Server, or other binaries. A Container with all its binaries is called an Image. You create a container from a file.

You can see the difference between Virtual Machines and Container technologies here:

<img src="https://cloudblogs.microsoft.com/uploads/prod/sites/37/2019/07/Demystifying-containers_image1.png" width=600>

This abstraction holds everything for an application to isolate it from other running processes. It is also completely portable - you can create an image on one system, and another system can run it so long as the same Container Runtime (Such as Docker) is installed. Containers also start very quickly, are easy to create (called Composing) using a simple text file with instructions of what to install (called a manifest or Dockerfile) on the image. The instructions pull the base image, and then any binaries you want to install. Several pre-built Containers are already available, and SQL Server is one of these. You can <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/linux/quickstart-install-connect-docker?view=sql-server-2017">read more about installing SQL Server on Container Runtimes (Such as Docker) at this reference</a>.

You can have several Containers running at any one time, based on the amount of hardware resources where you run it. For scale-out systems, a Container allows for distribution and control of complete applications using only declarative commands.

You can <a href="https://hackernoon.com/docker-commands-the-ultimate-cheat-sheet-994ac78e2888">read more about Container Runtimes (Such as Docker) at this reference</a>.

<h3>SQL Server on Kubernetes</h3>
For Big Data systems, having lots of Containers is very advantageous to segment purpose and performance profiles. However, dealing with many Container Images, allowing persisted storage, and interconnecting them for network and internetwork communications is a complex task. One such Container Orchestration tool is <i>Kubernetes</i>, an open source Container orchestrator, which can scale Container deployments according to need. The following table defines some important Container Orchestration Tools (Such as Kubernetes or OpenShift) terminology:

<table style="tr:nth-child(even) {background-color: #f2f2f2;}; text-align: left; display: table; border-collapse: collapse; border-spacing: 5px; border-color: gray;">
  <tr><td style="background-color: AliceBlue; color: black;"><b>Component</b></td><td style="background-color: AliceBlue; color: black;"><b>Used for</b></td></tr>
  <tr><td>Cluster</td><td> Container Orchestration (Such as Kubernetes or OpenShift) cluster is a set of machines, known as nodes. One node controls the cluster and is designated the master node; the remaining nodes are worker nodes. The Container Orchestration *master* is responsible for distributing work between the workers, and for monitoring the health of the cluster.</td></tr>
  <tr><td style="background-color: AliceBlue; color: black;">Node</td><td td style="background-color: AliceBlue; color: black;"> A node runs containerized applications. It can be either a physical machine or a virtual machine. A Cluster can contain a mixture of physical machine and virtual machines as Nodes.</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Pod</td><td> A Pod is the atomic deployment unit of a Cluster. A pod is a logical group of one or more Containers and associated resources needed to run an application. Each Pod runs on a Node; a Node can run one or more Pods. The Cluster master automatically assigns Pods to Nodes in the Cluster.</td></tr>
</table>

You can <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/tutorials/kubernetes-basics/" target="_blank">learn much more about Container Orchestration systems here</a>. You can implement a Kubernetes environment using the Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), and <a href="https://aksworkshop.io/" target="_blank">you can find a set of tutorials for you to learn more at this reference</a>.

> You can <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/tutorials/kubernetes-basics/create-cluster/cluster-interactive/">practice with Kubernetes using online emulator to work with the `minikube` platform</a>.  

You can deploy the latest version of SQL Server deployments on Kubernetes. In this case, the Container Orchestration system (Such as Kubernetes or OpenShift) is responsible for the state of the BDC; it is responsible for building and configuring the Nodes, assigns Pods to Nodes,creates and manages the Persistent Volumes (durable storage), and manages the operation of the Cluster.

You can learn more about <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/shows/data-exposed/deploying-sql-server-2019-in-kubernetes">deploying SQL Server to Kubernetes at this reference</a>. SQL Server containers can also be deployed to Kubernetes using Helm charts.  To understand how to deploy a container to Kubernetes see this Microsoft Learn article: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/linux/sql-server-linux-containers-deploy-helm-charts-kubernetes?view=sql-server-ver16

<h2 id="3.2"><img style="float: left; margin: 0px 15px 15px 0px;" src="https://github.com/microsoft/sqlworkshops/blob/master/graphics/pencil2.png?raw=true">3.2 Manageability</h2>

For the administration team for the Data Estate, manageability includes everything from the interface to the system, to being able to deploy and configure it. The latest version of SQL Server includes the following improvements:

- An integrated setup experience for the Azure extension for SQL Server which installs the Azure extension for SQL Server at setup
- You can now use the SQL Server Configuration Manager to manage an Azure extension for SQL Server service, allowing you to create Azure Arc-enabled SQL Server instances, and for other Azure connected features
- There are new upgraded max server memory calculations
- There are several improvements to address persistent version store (PVS) storage and improve overall scalability, including a persistent version store cleaner thread per database instead of per instance and the memory footprint for PVS page tracker has been improved. There are also a number of ADR efficiency improvements, such as concurrency improvements that help the cleanup process to work more efficiently. ADR cleans pages that couldn't previously be cleaned due to locking
- A new shrink database option has been added: WAIT_AT_LOW_PRIORITY
- XML compression is now available
- There is a new improvement for asynchronous auto update statistics concurrency

<h3>Tools</h3>
There are several tools you can use to connect to, query, and manage a SQL Server Instance. The two broad groups are Graphical User Interfaces (GUI) and Command-Line or Scripting Interfaces.

New improvements include:

- Azure Data Studio includes connection and management support for the latest version of SQL Server
- SQL Server Management Studio connects and manages the latest version of SQL Server, and includes several other improvements
- SqlPackage.exe provides support for the latest version of SQL Server
- VS Code now supports the latest version of SQL Server

<p></p>

> This Module focuses on the use and improvements in the SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) and Command-Line utilities. The Azure SQL Module will focus more on the Azure Data Studio (ADS) tool, although both SSMS and ADS can be used to connect to and manage either platform.

<p></p>

<h2 id="3.3"><img style="float: left; margin: 0px 15px 15px 0px;" src="https://github.com/microsoft/sqlworkshops/blob/master/graphics/pencil2.png?raw=true">3.3 Availability</h2>

One of the important considerations for WideWorld Importers is ensuring Business Continuity. As part of their strategy, the Data Estate is an important component. The general area for Business Continuity in Data is <i>High Availablity</i>, which in turn contains important concepts such as Recovery Point Objectives (RPO) and Recovery Time Objectives (RTO). A few key terms are important to note as we dsicuss the improvements in this area of the latest version of SQL Server: 

- <b>High Availability</b> (HA): The ability for your systems to recover from localized events in an automated way
- <b>Disaster Recovery</b> (DR): The process of recoving from a diaster of some sort.  A natural or man-made disaster has occured and manual intervention may be required.  While some things can be automated, other items may require manual intervention  
- <b>Business Continuity</b>: The planning process for how businesses and their IT systems will react in the event of an outage.  This planning will typically be for DR, but it could also include HA planning

There are multiple capabilities in SQL Server that serve as part of an overall Availability strategy, including several that have new improvements in the latest version:
- <b>Database Backups</b>
  - <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/relational-databases/integrated-acceleration/overview?view=sql-server-ver16">Intel QAT backup hardware offloading support</a> 
  - T-SQL Snapshot Backup, <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/relational-databases/backup-restore/create-a-transact-sql-snapshot-backup?view=sql-server-ver16">adding Transact-SQL support for freezing and thawing I/O without requiring a VDI client</a>
  - <i>backupset</i> (Transact-SQL) improvements to add additional columns
  - <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/relational-databases/backup-restore/sql-server-backup-to-url-s3-compatible-object-storage?view=sql-server-ver16">Backup and restore to S3-compatible object storage</a>
- <b>Database and Database article Replication</b>
  - "Last Writer Wins" conflict detection
- <b>Database Log Shipping</b>
- <b>Failover Clustering</b> 
  - Simplfied Failover Clustering setup for Virtual Machines 
- <b>Always-On Availability Groups</b> - <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/database-engine/availability-groups/windows/contained-availability-groups-overview?view=sql-server-ver16">Improvements in the latest version of SQL Server include</a>:
  - Up to five synchronous replicas	<a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/database-engine/availability-groups/windows/secondary-replica-connection-redirection-always-on-availability-groups?view=sql-server-ver16">starting in SQL Server 2019 (15.x) increases the maximum number of synchronous replicas to 5, up from 3 in SQL Server 2017 (14.x)</a>. You can configure this group of five replicas to have automatic failover within the group. There is one primary replica, plus four synchronous secondary replicas
  - Secondary-to-primary replica connection redirection	allows client application connections to be directed to the primary replica regardless of the target server specified in the connection string
  - Create an <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/database-engine/availability-groups/windows/contained-availability-groups-overview?view=sql-server-ver16">Always On Contained Availability Group</a> that manages its own metadata objects (users, logins, permissions, SQL Agent jobs etc.) at the availability group level in addition to the instance level, and includes specialized contained system databases within the availability group

> The latest version of SQL Server also has the ability to participate in Availablity to and from the Microsoft Azure Platform. These improvements will be detailed in the last Module of this Workshop.

<p><img style="float: left; margin: 0px 15px 15px 0px;" src="https://github.com/microsoft/sqlworkshops/blob/master/graphics/point1.png?raw=true"><b>Activity: Examine the new Information in the backupset system table</b></p>

The <i>backupset</i> table in the <i>msdb</i> system database contains a row for each backup set. A backup set contains the backup from a single, successful backup operation. You can use this information to check for your backup status, time to run, and much more. These checks should be integrated into your overall Disaster Recovery strategy.

<h4>The Query Data Store </h4>
The Query Store feature provides you with insight on query plan choice and performance for SQL Server, Azure SQL Database, Azure SQL Managed Instance, and Azure Synapse Analytics. The Query Store simplifies performance troubleshooting by helping you quickly find performance differences caused by query plan changes. Query Store automatically captures a history of queries, plans, and runtime statistics, and retains these for your review. It separates data by time windows so you can see database usage patterns and understand when query plan changes. the Query Store is used by all the Intelligent Database and Intelligent Query Performance improvements. Improvements in the latest version of SQL Server for Query Store include:

- <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/relational-databases/performance/monitoring-performance-by-using-the-query-store?view=sql-server-ver15#query-store-for-secondary-replicas">Query Store on secondary replicas</a> enables the same Query Store functionality on secondary replica workloads that is available for primary replicas

Over the past ten years, <a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/">SQL Server has had fewer vulnerabilities than any other major database platform </a>. Building on this security posture, several new improvements and features have been added to increase security for the platform.

<h4>Data Classification and Access Control Enhancements</h4>
Data Discovery and Classification is a new set of commands and metadata that allow you to "tag" columns of data in your databases with standard or configurable labels, from Transact-SQL statements or by using the graphical interface in SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS).
<p></p>

<p></p>
There are a new set of Server-level Roles in the newest version of SQL Server to enable least privileged access for administrative tasks that apply to the whole SQL Server Instance. You can <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/relational-databases/security/authentication-access/server-level-roles?view=sql-server-ver15#fixed-server-level-roles-introduced-in-sql-server-2022">learn more about these roles at this reference</a>.

<h4>Dynamic Data Masking, Row-Level Security and Always Encrypted Improvements</h4>
Fine-grained encryption and data-level masking are important tools for the administrators and developers of data applications to completely secure data access, all while reducing the coding load. Several new improvements provide these capabilities.

<b>Dynamic Data Masking</b>
Dynamic data masking (DDM) helps prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data by enabling you to specify how much sensitive data to reveal, all with minimal impact on the application layer. DDM can be configured on designated database fields to hide sensitive data in the result sets of queries. 

> With DDM, the data in the database isn't changed. DDM is easy to use with existing applications, since masking rules are applied in the query results.

You can <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/relational-databases/security/dynamic-data-masking?view=sql-server-ver16">learn more about Dynamic Data Masking and find a tutorial on implementing it at this reference</a>.

<b>Row-Level Security</b>
Row-Level Security enables you to use Role membership or execution context to control access to rows in a database table. Row-Level Security (RLS) simplifies the design and coding of security in your application, since the access restriction logic is located in the database tier rather than away from the data in another application tier.

<b>Always Encrypted with Secure Enclaves</b>
the latest version of SQL Server expands on the <i>Always Encrypted</i> fesatures with in-place encryption and rich computations by enabling computations on plaintext data inside a server-side secure enclave. In-place encryption improves the performance and the reliability of cryptographic operations (encrypting columns, rotating columns, encryption keys, and so on), because it avoids moving data out of the database.

This improvement also supports rich computations (pattern matching and comparison operations) which unlocks Always Encrypted to a much broader set of scenarios and applications that demand sensitive data protection, while also requiring richer functionality in Transact-SQL queries.

You can <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/relational-databases/security/encryption/always-encrypted-enclaves?view=sql-server-ver15">read more about Always Encrypted with Secure Enclaves at this reference</a>.

<h4>Auditing Enhancements</h4>
Auditing in SQL Server is now improved to include a new field called <i>data_sensitivity_information</i> in the audit log record, which contains the sensitivity classifications (labels) of the actual data that was returned by the query, which leverages the Data Classification features shown earlier.

You can <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/relational-databases/security/auditing/sql-server-audit-database-engine?view=sql-server-ver15">learn more about Auditing in SQL Server at this reference</a>.

<h4>Ledger</h4>
Establishing trust around the integrity of data stored in database systems has been a longstanding problem for all organizations that manage financial, medical, or other sensitive data. The ledger feature provides tamper-evidence capabilities in your database. You can cryptographically attest to other parties, such as auditors or other business parties, that your data hasn't been tampered with.

The latest version of SQL Server includes a new feature called <i>Ledger</i> which, once enabled on a table, adds a hashed value (a Block) at the end of each row of data, and a computed hashed value from those Blocks (representing a Chain of Blocks) to uniquely identify the data in the database. A Digest is created for those values, which can be in separate, protected storage, to compare the state of the internal blockchain to an immutable copy, which can prove whether data has been tampered with.
